NAME
    Lingua::Sinica::PerlYuYan - Perl in Classical Chinese in Perl

SYNOPSIS
        # The Sieve of Eratosthenes - 埃拉托斯芬篩法
        use Lingua::Sinica::PerlYuYan;

        用籌兮用嚴  井涸兮無礙。
        印曰最高矣  又道數然哉。
        截起吾純風  賦小入大合。
        習予吾陣地  並二至純風。
        當起段賦取  加陣地合始。
        陣地賦篩始  繫繫此雜段。
        終陣地兮印  正道次標哉。
        輸空接段點  列終註泰來。

DESCRIPTION
    The Lingua::Sinica::PerlYuYan makes it possible to write Perl programs
    in Classical Chinese poetry in Perl.

    (If you *have* to ask "Why?", please refer to Lingua::Romana::Perligata
    for related information.)

    This module uses the single-character property of Chinese to
    disambiguate between keywords, thus whitespaces could be elided much
    like in real Chinese writings.

    The vocabulary is in the 文言 (literary text) mode, not much used in
    modern Chinese society; the common mode is 白話 (spoken text) mode with
    multisyllabic words.

    You could use "Lingua::Sinica::PerlYuYan::translate()" (or simply as
    "譯()") to translate a string containing English programs into Chinese.
