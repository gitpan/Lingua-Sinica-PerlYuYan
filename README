* Introduction

The Lingua::Sinica::PerlYuYan makes it makes it possible to write
Perl programs in Chinese. (If you have to ask "Why?", please refer to
Lingua::Romana::Perligata for related information.)

This module uses the single-character property of Chinese to disambiguate
between keyword matches; whitespaces could be omitted this way, much
as in real Chinese writings.

The vocabulary is of the WenYanWen (文言文, literary text) mode, not
much used in modern Chinese, which prefers the BaiHuaWen (白話文, spoken
text) with multiple-syllable words.
