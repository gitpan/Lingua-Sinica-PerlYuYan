(Based on a conversation from http://www.plurk.com/p/2ih40z)

“其實這想法很簡單：
 NDS 上有一款 Scribblenaut 游戲，
 小孩畫什麼就會出現什麼。”

The idea is actually simple. On 兔肝猴 there's a game called 撰空, where kids
can sketch out arbitrary concepts and it would automagically manifest in-game.

“從小看楚辭長大的小孩，
 自然就會希望自己寫“昨夜西風凋碧樹”
 就真的跑出碧樹來。”

So a kid growing up reading ancient romanticist poems, would naturally wish
that penning "the sacred river Alph" and a river would actually appear.

“後來小孩長大了一點發現可以寫程式做到這件事。
 就醬。:-)”

Then the kid grew up a bit and discovered programming can actually project
infantile omnipotence into a transitional zone. That's it. :-)

                                          ...

“後來照顧小孩的叔叔姑姑伯伯嬸嬸各自搬走，
 小孩心臟病很嚴重不能旅行，
 只能寫詩想念他們。”

Shortly afterward, the kid's primary caretakers - many uncles and aunts - formed
families themselves and moved far away; the kid was born with severe ventricular
septal defect and cannot travel at all, so the kid poured wailing into poetry.

“後來發現這些詩只要押了特定的 P 韻腳，
 像是 TCP, UDP, IP, HTTP, XMPP，
 就有魔力。”

After a while, the kid had a discovery: As long as the poems rhymes on -協,
such as 傳控協, 用信協, 跨協, 超文傳協 and 擴訊現協, mysterious power would
appear out of nowhere.

“後來再大一點，和其他人一起寫詩劇，
 演成噗浪和臉書，
 叔叔姑姑伯伯嬸嬸真的都進入詩的世界了。”

So the kid first wrote closet drama, and later learned to compose huge verses
based on multipart/mixed playwrights.

Then the Age of Melodrama came, and the scripts from the previous Age were
publicly performed on the stages of Twitter and Facebook.

And the Real uncles and aunts, still alive, now register into the kid's
Imaginary zone conjured from sheer Symbolic power.

“以上是對於拉岡 Sinthome 概念的實例講解。:-)”

The above is a field report illustrating Lacan's idea of 心慟. :-)

13:48 <nothingmuch> use Time::HiRes qw(time);
13:48 <audreyt> right, it's the era of 64 bits
13:49 <nothingmuch> =)
...next...
13:51  * nothingmuch will use /usr/bin/uuidgen
13:52 <nothingmuch> since there's no concept of "time" then the version you should use is competely incidential
13:52 <audreyt> I'll reserve that for my next art project. :)
...reset...
14:00 <audreyt> may I quote you (under CC0 license!) in the commit log and Changes file? :)
14:01 <nothingmuch> i relinquish all rights to my wisdom or lack thereof
14:01 <nothingmuch> (hopefully i give up responsibility too ;-)
14:02 <audreyt> you do :D there was no responsibility to begin with
...shift...
13:52 <nothingmuch> in fact, software does not exist
13:53 <audreyt> it's the very nonexistence that makes it work... that is the essence of मध्यमिक
13:53 <audreyt> Nagarjuna was very much a hacker
13:54 <audreyt> it's said that Nagarjuna comprehended pretty much everything, and practiced shadow nijutsu and hacked into the 
                royal residence during adolescence
13:54 <audreyt> along with a peer, who got caught by the royal guard and promptedly killed
13:55 <audreyt> so Nagarjuna sat down and wrote Fundamental Verses of the Middle Way and Seventy Verses on Emptiness, 
                effectively hacked the indic culture into Hegel's shape, just much earlier...
13:56 <audreyt> then Tang XuanZang ported it to Chinese during Emperor Lee's reign (Tang and Lee happens to be my parents' 
                families)
13:56 <audreyt> as the Heart Sutra
13:57 <audreyt> "Essence of Wisdom Sutra", which is chanted everyday in CJKV by common people
13:57 <audreyt> I ported that to Unix a couple weeks ago as 
13:57 <audreyt>     sync;sync;shutdown -k;halt -lnqu
...comefrom...
14:02 <audreyt> "sync; sync; sudo sync; sudo shutdown -k; sudo halt -lnqu"
14:03 <audreyt> was my (working) translation
...goto...
13:58 <audreyt> which is what I now use daily whenever I get into an online situation where flamewar is immediate
13:58 <audreyt> ...so I gets (as promised by the Sutra) absolute immunity over flamewars
13:58 <nothingmuch> §=)
13:58 <audreyt> ...now I'd just have to do that again in realspace too :)
13:58 <audreyt> .
13:58 <nothingmuch> i wonder what that typo means
13:59 <nothingmuch> perhaps it's an enlightened smiley
13:59 <audreyt> converging infinity? :)
13:59 <audreyt> yeah, it's beautiful
...last...
14:04 <audreyt> well, translations evolve, too :) we'll probably revisit many times with reified control...
14:05 <audreyt> in realspace though, it's 10pm and I gotta go home and sleep. ttyl!
14:05 <nothingmuch> ciao ciao
14:05 <nothingmuch> i need to do laundry and rehearse myself
14:06 <audreyt> :D see ya!
